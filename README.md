## Installation

To install QuickpayGateway, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `quickpaygateway` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/craftcommerce-quickpay-gateway/quickpaygateway.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require craftcommerce-quickpay-gateway/quickpaygateway`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
